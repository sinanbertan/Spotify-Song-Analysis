# Spotify Song Analysis

This project is an analysis of a dataset related to Spotify songs using Python.



## Data Source

 - The two datasets used in this project contain information about songs available on Spotify, including attributes such as artist, name, popularity, duration, tempo, and more. The first dataset contains information on 586672  songs and was obtained from Kaggle here(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db). The second dataset contains information on 232725 songs was obtained from Kaggle here(https://www.kaggle.com/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets?select=artists.csv).


## Installation
The following tools were used for this analysis:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

- To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries by running the following command:


- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

    
## Usage 
- To run the analysis, simply execute the notebook. The script will generate several visualizations that help illustrate analysis of data.
## Roadmap

The analysis includes the following tasks:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Correlation analysis

The analysis includes visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Result

- The analysis reveals interesting insights about the two datasets, such as the most popular artists and genres, the relationship between song features such as energy, loudness, and valence, and the differences between the two datasets in terms of song features.
